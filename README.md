# Rails Test Helper 

This is an extension for Visual Code Studio. It contains a couple of utilities to help with TDD tasks while working on a Ruby on Rails application.

1. Toggle between an implementation file and it's corresponding test file.
2. _TODO_ Run a test at the current line number. Running the command from the top of the file will run all of the tests 

## Default keybinding

* Assumes Rails conventions and directory structure
* Does not work with RSpec (yet)
